# LoginLayout-java-Project

was planning to do this as a project using jdbc and GUI but came across a brillient idea and I have always wanted to try that out so instead of doing this as my project ,made a last minute jump to https://github.com/Joel-Nickson/Maze-in-java

If there is anyone out in the world wide web who comes across this and wants to try this one out , I have left a sample in https://github.com/Joel-Nickson/JavaLogin/tree/main/JavaLoginAssignment .Although not perfect it think it will act as an excellent starting point for anyone trying to continue with a similar project.
